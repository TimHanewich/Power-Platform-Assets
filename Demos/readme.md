# Power Platform Solutions for Demonstrations
Please note not all of these solutions are *fully* functional. They are available *as-is* and I do not guarentee they will function as expected.

## Demo Directory
You can find a directory of the Power Platform-based demonstrable content below:

### Department of Corrections
These demos are specifically crafted for a Department of Corrections.

|[Facility Intelligence](./Corrections-Facility-AI/)|Azure's Facial Recognition capabilities are used to track the movement of residents throughout a facility. Alerts are generated for high-risk encounters/situations. Audio logs from inside the facility are transcribed with Azure speech-to-text. High-risk discussions that pose a risk to the facility are flagged and reported to guards.
