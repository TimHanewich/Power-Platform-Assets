# Power Platform Solutions for Demonstrations
Please note not all of these solutions are *fully* functional. They are available *as-is* and I do not guarentee they will function as expected.

## Demo Directory
### Department of Corrections
These demos are specifically crafted for a Department of Corrections.
|Title|Description|
|-|-|
|[Resident Mail Processing](./Offender-Mail-Processing/)|Offender mail is scanned and passed through an algorithm that detects high-risk words and phrases that may pose a risk to the facility and staff/resident safety.|
|[Resident Processing and Badge Generation](./Offender-Mail-Processing/)|A solution for processing residents (capturing information, body imagery, etc) and generating a badge. Also an app for guards to use to scan the badge and document disciplinary action.|
|[Parolee Management](./DOC-Parole-Check-In/)|Parolees can log into a portal on their mobile device and an app in the waiting room ahead of a parole appointment. The parole/probabtion officer can review this information before the meeting while the system flags high-risk changes and guides their attention.|
|[Facility Intelligence](./Corrections-Facility-AI/)|Azure's Facial Recognition capabilities are used to track the movement of residents throughout a facility. Alerts are generated for high-risk encounters/situations. Audio logs from inside the facility are transcribed with Azure speech-to-text. High-risk discussions that pose a risk to the facility are flagged and reported to guards.
