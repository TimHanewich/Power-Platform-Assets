# Request for Leave
The State of Nebraska approached my broader Microsoft team regarding the need to modernize their time off requesting application for state employees. After initial discovery, requirements gathering, and collaborative design, I created a request for leave minimally viable product for the state to visual the Power Platform in such a use case.

The solution fully supports the requesting leave process, approval routing, staffing forecasts, and team request reviewing.
