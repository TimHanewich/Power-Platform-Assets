# Jury Questionnaire
The State Judicial Branch we worked with on this was physically handing out pieces of paper with questions on them to the jury members for a case. The jury members would circle their answers, write their responses, and turn the paper in. A staff member would then enter this data into a database by hand. This "proof of concept" illustrates how you could use a Power Apps portal to instead have a web-based solution for the jury members to submit their responses.
