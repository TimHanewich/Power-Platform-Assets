# Permitting Chatbot - Power Virtual Agents
This roundtable demonstrates the capabilities of Power Virtual Agents. We will design a chatbot to assist a citizen with applying for a well permit in the State of Colorado. The chatbot will take information from the user such as well location, well depth, contact information, etc. and create a well permit application in Dataverse for the user, and then provide that user with their application ID. The intention is for this chatbot to be embedded in a citizen-facing environment department website/portal.
