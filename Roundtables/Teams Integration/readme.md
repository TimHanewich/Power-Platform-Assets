# Power Apps & Teams Integration
So many people use teams! The purpose of this roundtable is to show how easy it is to embed a Power App directly within teams. You don't have to navigate to a web browser to use a power app. By embedding a power app in a team, you can use your app right from the convenience of Teams.

- Solutions
    - ["End state" solution](./Solutions/TeamRequest_1_0_0_4.zip)
    - [Data model and app only](./Solutions/TeamRequestDataModelandAppOnly_1_0_0_1.zip)
        - Use this as a starting point for the roundtable
        - Since the group at this point has seen how to build tables and apps, there is no need to show them again. Focus time on the topic at hand - the integration piece.

## Guest Appearence
Our partner, Catapult, has partaken in this third session in the past. Catapult has a much more fleshed out, enterprise-ready, solution that can be rapidly deployed with any customer, commercial or GCC. Their solution is a "Teams governance" power app. The solution is designed to allow users in an organization submit requests for Teams teams, avoid duplicate naming, set permissions, open channels, etc. With the integration demo not taking much time, Catapult takes up a good portion of this session with their demonstration.
