## Solution Packages
Click on the links below to download the solution packages.
- [Foundation only](https://timhmsft.blob.core.windows.net/downloadable/TimeOffRequestFoundation_1_0_0_1.zip?sp=r&st=2023-01-23T17:52:10Z&se=2099-01-24T01:52:10Z&sv=2021-06-08&sr=b&sig=w0nINKDgJGx2GL4pjPPDgk9I%2BqgZ0aDvMM%2BcULPSezE%3D)
    - Use this solution as a starting place for the live build
    - This solution contains:
        - Leave Request table
        - Request for Leave Reason Choice
        - Leave Request Management Model-Driven App (and site map)
        - User table
    - This solution does NOT contain the Canvas App, which is what you will create in the live demonstration.
- [Completed Build](https://timhmsft.blob.core.windows.net/downloadable/TimeOffRequestFinished_1_0_0_3.zip?sp=r&st=2023-01-23T17:52:40Z&se=2099-01-24T01:52:40Z&sv=2021-06-08&sr=b&sig=%2BxwFBmRgjuljwvFW%2FQG%2B0Jex1C3dJhMrouR9zrzfzPk%3D)
    - This is the intended finished state after the live build demonstration
    - I recommend installing this in a separate environment and using this as a guideline on a second monitor while performing the live build demonsration
- [Finished app, but without accessibility features](https://timhmsft.blob.core.windows.net/downloadable/TimeOffRequestWithoutAccessibilityFeaturesAdded_1_0_0_4.zip?sp=r&st=2023-01-23T17:53:10Z&se=2099-01-24T01:53:10Z&sv=2021-06-08&sr=b&sig=RF2QO2rejDvPZNo0WyQam5J5dgVctVfmH%2FO3wA2fpjY%3D) - If you wish to provide only a short demo, from the finished app state but **without** the Accessibility features added yet, use this build.

## Solution Packages, V2
- [This](https://github.com/TimHanewich/Power-Platform-Assets/releases/download/16/TimeOffRequest_1_0_0_4.zip) is a completed leave request app (full solution) that is truly *fully* accessible. A lot of stuff was tweaked from V1 above and it is now fully responsive, so can be used at high magnification levels with screen readers.
- [This](https://github.com/TimHanewich/Power-Platform-Assets/releases/download/18/Submit.Leave.Request.msapp) is only the standalone Power App, not a solution. This app is the same app that appears in the solution package above, but with any ties to Tables/Options severed. Thus, this app does not actually save any data, it is meant only for front-end UI demonstration purposes.
