# Detecting Fish Species with AI Builder
In this session we build and train an AI model to automatically detect a species of fish from an image. This is for a Department of Fish and Wildlife use case in which field workers survey anglers. Instead of capturing an image *and* selecting the fish species from a drop down, the field worker only needs to capture the image of the fish. The AI model detects and selects the species automatically.

- I provide a solution file with the pre-trained AI builder module below. But if you'd like to train one yourself, here is a [link to download a reposity of fish pictures for each species]() that you will need to supply to the model during training.
