# Roundtable Content
Here I document all content that I use to provide a series of "Power Platform Roundtables" with a customer.

## What is a Roundtable?
A *roundtable* is a condensed "infosession" focusing on one particular feature of the Power Platform. I have had success conducting one roundtable per state at a predetermined regular interval. For example, hosting a New Mexico Roundtable every 3 months. Each session is designed to cover a different topic in the platform.

## Roundtable Content
In addition to the information I am providing on that partiuclar topic, I spend the majority of the call actually **building** a simple example of leveraging that feature or functionality in the platform. I start from a predetermined development point and flesh out something from scratch. The purpose is for the audience to recognize that despite only have several hours together, we are able to walk away with a significant miniminally viable product.

## Roundtable Structure
Below is my high-level structure. Each roundtable is a 2-hour time block.
- Welcome and roundtable overview (5 minutes)
- Recap last roundtable (2 minutes)
- Introduce today's topic (5 minutes)
- Demo the solution we will build today (5 minutes)
- Build the solution live (1 hr, 20 mins)
- Q&A (30 mins)

## Content
Below I have linked to all of the content involved in the roundtables I have conducted thus far. This includes a **presentation deck**, **solution package**, **script**, and **recording** of sessions I have conducted with that content. I will continue to update this repository as new content is developed.
